### NOTES ###
# This will build ruby-2.0.0 specifically for RHEL/Centos 6.5 - no others at this time.
#
# Do not use this tool as the root user - use as a non-privileged user only.
#
# Start this command in the root directory containing the opencrowbar.org GIT clone trees
#   This script checks that the build-tools repo clone is in the current directory,
#   If not found, it checks for its existence in the $HOME/opencrowbar directory
#
# Building of ruby-2.0.0 requires the following packages to be pre-installed on the build
#   system: autoconf, gdbm-devel, ncurses-devel, db4-devel, libffi-devel, openssl-devel
#           libyaml-devel, readline-devel, tk-devel, procps, systemtap-sdt-devel (dtrace)
#
# This script currently only allows building of ruby-2.0.0.
